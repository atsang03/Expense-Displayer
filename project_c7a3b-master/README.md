# My Personal Project

## Expense Displayer

My project is an expense displayer/organizer
 that will have the ability to show categorized
expenses in different graphical displays and organize
many different expenses into categories.
Features include making graphical displays
 and being able to organize the expenses
from highest to lowest, alphabetical, categories, etc.
I believe that the people who are going to use this
are the ones who want to keep organized or people
who want to keep track of how much and what they are
spending. This project interests me because at this time
with the pandemic going on, having less work has put people in 
situations where they have to micromanage their expenses.
I believe that by making an application like this, it will
help keep track of tedious but necessary money managing.
 
examples of graphical displays:
- Pie chart
- bar graph

examples of features:
- Highest to lowest (vice versa)
- alphabetical
- categories
- by months
